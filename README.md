# vscode-to-vs
This tool allows you to create the files needed for a Visual Studio C++ project so that you can continue coding on a Mac with Visual Studio Code and then submit the Visual Studio project for Class Assignments
## Usage:
`./vscode-to-vs [ProjectName] ["File Path"]`
The file path should be the path to the folder that holds all the VS Code C++ files
#### Example:
`./vscode-to-vs Lab10 "/Users/wzid/Documents/Lab 10"`

A new folder will be created inside the original folder with all of the files ready to be zipped and submitted for assignment submission
